 * This module is for normalizing events. Mouse and Touch events will be

 * matter the source. We hope that eventually a system like this one will be
 * standard and available from the platform.
 * Events fired:
 *   - pointertap: click
 *   - pointerdown: a pointing is added
 *   - pointerup: a pointer is removed
 *   - pointermove: a pointer is moved
 *   - pointerenter: a pointer enters the boundaries of an element
 *   - pointerleave: a pointer leaves the boundaries of an element

     * Hooks are how rich gesture events are created: by listening to normalized
     * pointer events, gesture code can be much simpler.

     * Users can add custom hooks with `registerHook` to create new pointer events.

       * As of now, the only way to distinguish between the two states of
       * MouseEvent.button is by using the deprecated MouseEvent.which property,

       * that no mouse button is held.
       *
       * MouseEvent.which is derived from MouseEvent.button at MouseEvent
       * creation, but initMouseEvent does not expose an argument with which to
       * set MouseEvent.which. Calling initMouseEvent with a buttonArg of 0 will
       * set MouseEvent.button == 0 and MouseEvent.which == 1, breaking the
       * expectations of app developers.
       *
       * The only way to propagate the correct state of MouseEvent.which and
       * MouseEvent.button to a new MouseEvent.button == 0 and MouseEvent.which == 0
       * is to call initMouseEvent with a buttonArg value of -1.
